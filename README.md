## MVP product 
**showcasing the use of different strategies and tools to achieve**
**set of goals in unite manner and free of charge for educational purposes**

### Description
In this example we have two apps.
First one is tracking NFT data from [jpg.store](https://jpg.store) for specific
NFTs/Collections and share detected changes across the networks in adequate formats.
Data is shared on Twitter and Discord using automated accounts. It is also stored on Google drive/sheets 
This data is taken directly from market pages with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), as there is no API for jpg.store.
It is running on replit's dev servers.
Second app with [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is used for presenting this data with charts and tables.
This data is taken from Google sheet in pandas dataframe format and presented using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and tables. 
[AWS EC2 micro](https://aws.amazon.com/) instance is used in this case.

#### Covered:
- scraping data from different (open/public) web locations and public and private APIs
- tracking, analyzing and sharing data through social and other networks
- different tools, apps and servers to achieve these goals.

#### Not Covered
- implementation of AI models
- AI assisted developing
- blockchain

#### Findings
There are many possible paths to take, limitless offer of all kinds of tools one can imagine. 
With the right approach anything can be done, imagination is the only boundary... 
Still sometimes it can be very tricky to combine different parts/modules to work in sync. 
And as everything is moving quickly and AI becomes more and more powerful, we can expect great challenges and changes in every aspect of our lives. 
Adapting is the must.
